{"text_snippet": {"content": "Give this young Cab time in the cellar to come around. Right now, it's fresh and tannic, with primary fruit blackberry and cherry flavors, and the sweet smoky oak hasn't been integrated. Should knit together over the next 4-6 years, at least."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "The color is just beginning to show signs of browning at the edge, but the wine is still fresh and vibrant. The nose is complex, showing licorice, summer fruits, caramel and roses. On the palate, it is soft and pleasant, but lacks some concentration.  At its peak, but will drink well for a few years."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This wine's black cherry and plum flavors veer dangerously toward prune‚Äîno doubt a product of the exceedingly hot summer. It's creamy and supple in texture, adding just enough tobacco, vanilla and smoke for complexity. But for all the fruit and ripeness, it finishes with great elegance and precision. Drink now‚Äì2020. Imported by Acadia Imports."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This is great Chenin Blanc, wood fermented but still leaving all the varietal character. Rich, creamy, almond flavors and silky smooth, which keeps all the essential acidity of the grape, with added spice and vanilla."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Mid-gold color. Very mineral driven with subtle aromas of bruised apple and stone fruit compote. Crisp, fairly taut palate showing strong minerality and ripe flavors of red apple, cantaloupe, sweet nectarine and spice. Taut and precise texture with a long, slightly austere finish."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Beautiful deep gold color. Intense, concentrated nose with vibrant aromas of honey, citrus marmalade and savory botrytis notes. Deliciously sweet and succulent, yet balanced by good acidity.  Packed with flavors of sweet ultra-ripe stone and tropical fruit, with honey and botrytis notes following through. Strong minerality prevails to a long, complex finish."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "A big, fat, luscious wine with plenty of toasty oak, dark jammy fruit and spices. The palate showed the same lushness; with the fruit front and center with surprising length.  A delicious, rather hefty effort short on finesse but long on flavor."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This is one of the more complex wines from the 2003 vintage. The nose has aromas of blackberry liquer, smoked meat, truffle and road tar. On the palate the fruit seems a little heavier and more roasted, but still melds well with its earthy, mushroomy flavors. Medium finish."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "A beautiful wine, sleek, crisp and ultra-dry, with the most refined flavors of petrol, white peach, kaffir lime, apricot skin and minerals. The acidity is very high and palate-cleansing. The wine was half fermented in barrels, half in stainless steel. Sommeliers, buy this by the case, if you can find it."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Rich gold in color. Broad, layered aromas of very ripe fruit with hints of sweet smoke, brown sugar, honey and a savory earthy minerality. Full-bodied, bone dry, but richly textured with crisp acidity and a wide palette of flavors, ripe stone fruit, a creamy savory earthiness, sage and a balsamic kick on the finish. Very long length, slightly warm but with a lingering savory, mineral finish."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Thick and brooding, this dark, sweetly tannic wine also offers higher-toned elements of cedar, dried herb and graphite. It finds its balance amid a full-bodied density of fruit concentration and girth of structure. Drink now through 2023."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Cooked cranberry is spiced with anise, peppercorn and roasted beef slices on this bottling from a vineyard planted by three brothers who are longtime Salinas Valley farmers. The palate shows dark cranberry and raspberry, spiced up by chopped sage, thyme and bay leaf."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "There's a touch of hot asphalt, pencil lead and miso on the nose of this first vintage from a promising, well-funded project, with dark elderberry fruit and dried dill rounding out the aromas. The palate blends a gamy beef quality with oregano, marjoram, cooked strawberry, baked blackberry and a sesame-oil character."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Black cherry, black plum and black currant are integrated well into the fresh dill and smoke scents on the nose of this wine from one of the region's newest properties. It discloses a rich dark-chocolate sauce character on the palate as well as black-currant-jelly flavors, but most impressive is the lush, sexy and soft mouthfeel."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Crisp, pristine peach and apricot notes resonate through the nose and palate of this fresh, blossomy dry Riesling. While zesty and lithe in body, ripe grapefruit and melon flavors feel supple and silky on the palate. Drink now through 2019."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Smashed blackberry and blueberry fruit are enhanced by burned caramel, heavy slate and touches of soy and smoke on the nose. There's great depth in both body and flavors once sipped, with a layer of fine-grained tannins revealing teriyaki, black plum, boysenberry and touches of lavender."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This wine shows off Yountville fruit at its finest, starting with a floral component to the nose. Spicy, bright and lifted, it coats the palate in ripe berry and cherry, ending with a snap of vanilla."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This bottling shows a rich, wood-aged wine, full of ripe yellow and tropical fruits as well as rich toasty flavors. The wine is warm, rounded, spicy and with its impressive structure still developing, it has the potential to age well. The wine is named to celebrate the second Lan√ßa generation in charge at the estate. Drink from 2017."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "From a promising new project, the nose of this wine is linear and focused, with black raspberry, black licorice, cola, wet sagebrush and rain-on-slate scents. The tactile acidity once sipped creates a fascinating soft buzz on the tongue, with flavors of dried mint, brisk raspberry and cherry tomato. Camphor and eucalyptus add intrigue on the finish."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Dark and thick in the glass, this wine shows strong but not bitter tar notes on the nose plus charred beef in a blueberry glaze, wet campfire, bourbon barrel and vanilla. The structure is massive now, gooey with thick tannins and flavors of espresso bean and condensed purple flowers. Judicious acidity ensures strong cellaring potential. Drink 2018‚Äì2027."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Ripe aromas of raisin, black plum and horsehide are pointy and peppery. On the palate, this Graciano is bold and energetic, with lifting acidity. Loud berry flavors come with strong accents of dark chocolate and bitter espresso, while the finish is long but just moderate in complexity. Drink through 2020."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Bradley Brown's appellation blend is a nice entry point to this exciting winery. This wine shows lavish smoked black currant and plum flavors, with aromatically lifting spices of anise and black pepper and a savory roast-beef element. The palate packs lots of pepper and relies on plump black cherry, boysenberry and a dark-chocolate syrup richness."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Approachably fruity yet nuanced and electrifying, there's exceptional value here. High-intensity flavors of tangerine and stone fruit sweeten the palate, balanced by nerve-tingling acidity and deep ripples of slate, salt and honeycomb. It's an intensely zesty wine, but the finish has length and power."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "From an estate in the south of the Alentejo, this is a rich, hot-country wine. It is firm, densely structured and with solid, dark tannins. There is a juicy black fruit background to this dense wine that gives a lift. Still young, this dark and very concentrated wine will be better from 2018."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Baked plum, Asian spice, vanilla and menthol aromas carry the nose. The elegantly structured palate offers fleshy black cherry, licorice, mint and well-integrated French oak alongside fine-grained tannins that lend firm, polished support. A coffee note marks the finish."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Intense aromas of ripe red berry, menthol, espresso and star anise lead the nose. The concentrated palate offers cranberry, dried Morello cherry, sage and licorice alongside close-grained tannins that grip the finish. Drink from 2018 through 2025."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Low-yield vines on the best parcels of the Vincens estate are the source of this wine. It is super-rich and concentrated, maybe too much in its opulent excess. The wine does have great plum and berry flavors that are generous and full in the mouth. The wine even now is still young and will be better from 2018."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "A hearty blend of 76% Zinfandel and 24% Petite Sirah, this bottling packs a wallop of cinnamon-stick on the nose as well as strawberry puree, licorice and black pepper. Clove, allspice, and nutmeg arise immediately on the sip, backed by baked plum and bay leaf notes."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "More complex than the winery's appellation blend, yet also requiring time to reach full potential, this shows delicate lemon slices, honeysuckle, surf wax, pink grapefruit and a touch of coconut on the nose. The palate is grippy in texture and sizzling with mouthwatering acidity, offering lemon rind, grapefruit spritz and petrol flavors. Expect inviting nut and honey-dust flavors to emerge. Drink 2018‚Äì2034."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Produced from vineyards donated to a charitable hospital in the 19th century, this wine is rich and now perfectly mature. It has smoky tannins that lie under the fine, elegant cherry and red plum fruits and acidity. The wine still has freshness although the attraction here is the ripe structure. The ornate label dates back to 1926."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot opens with blackened aromas of charred oak and creosote, but it quickly sheds that oak-heavy character to display toasty flavors of olives, herbs and berry fruits. All together, this is a classic Chilean red blend, with fine tannins and patented lightly herbal, balsamic flavors. Drink through 2020."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Dry, briary aromas of field brush, black olive, herbs, berry fruits and saucy tomato are textbook Maipo. This is fresh, a touch choppy, and not overly heavy. Flavors of cassis, plum and vanilla carry over to the finish, which is fresh and bolstered by fine natural acidity. Drink through 2022."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Of course, this 90% Tannat wine is still very young. But it's impressive, rich and concentrated and promises to age well. It is dense with both tannins and fruit, black plum and berry flavors dominating, cut by acidity. It will be ready to drink from 2019."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "The addition of 15% Petite Sirah takes this bottling to a compelling place, showing barely ripe blackberries, animal fat, smoke, black pepper and a wild clove element on the nose. It's rich and layered on the palate, where chalky tannins support black cherry, grilled beef and mint flavors. This has the bones to last awhile."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "A fairly elegant expression of the variety, this wine is bright in cherry kirsch and pretty aromas of rose petal and lavender, structured to age and enjoy with food. Rector Creek Vineyard is just north of Yountville and planted in rocky alluvial soils. Drink now through 2022."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This wine is put together from multiple vineyard sources, including the well-known Morelli Lane and Widdoes, all farmed by the Duttons. Larger in production than many of the vineyard-designates, it offers baked bread and juicy overtones of cranberry-raspberry layered atop luxuriously toasted oak. It'll show well at the table."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Fresh and fragrant of blossoms, tart yellow peach and apricot, this off-dry Riesling maintains a crystalline fruit purity that persists throughout Fritz Haag's wines. It's invigorating and irresistably quaffable. The long, melon-rind finish is lip smacking."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Just a touch of honey-lemon sweetness is enough to make this zesty, citrus-focused Riesling lip smackingly delicious. Fresh, green herb and lime notes reverberate through a strong finish. Drinks well now but should meld nicely over the next five years."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Dry, spicy aromas of tobacco, cedar, vanilla and berry fruits come together nicely. This Maule Valley Cab is fresh and harmonious across the palate, with nothing too pushy. Complex, balsamic flavors of olives, herbs, dried berries, turned earth and cocoa finish dry, peppery and elegant. Drink through 2019."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This wine is bursting with gorgeous cherry fruit, forward and luscious. The tannins are ripe and the acids in perfect proportion, keeping the fruit flavors buoyed upon a textural ride into a lingering finish."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "The Stoneleigh style traditionally favors ripeness over herbaceousness, and the 2008 holds true to form, offering up grapefruit and nectarine aromas and an appealing blend of citrus and stone-fruit flavors. It's plump and round, yet finishes fresh. Good as an ap√©ritif or with light dishes."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Crisp and fresh with enduring aromas of tomato leaf, citrus, pink grapefruit and white stone, this is textbook Sauvignon from the mountainous Alto Adige region of Italy. Pair it with appetizers or lightly spicy foods."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Haven't seen this unusual combination of grapes in quite some time, and you know what, it's much better now than when we last saw it in 2001. This vintage has a nice, almost magnetic nose, while the palate is firm and well structured, with cassis, black cherry, coffee and licorice flavors. It's a bit boring on the finish, but the mouthfeel and length are just fine. Fruity, rich and balanced. 325 cases made."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This Chianti Classico strikes a beautiful balance between elegance and intensity. It has both and its pretty aromas of wild berry, rose, ginger, anise and spice come forth in a continuous, steady manner. It feels bright and lively in the mouth and ends with a touch of piquant spice."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Black as a moonless night, dense in structure, tannic, bone dry and super-peppery, this Syrah isn't offering much relief right now. In all likelihood it will emerge from its cocoon in a few years to offer a wealth of ripe blackberry, currant and carob fruit."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "The impact of 50-year old vines is seen in the concentrated fruit, ripe and full,  in this wine. The flavors are of fresh apricots, edged with green apples and pink grapefruit, a combination that shows both richness and great freshness. The finish is a reminder of the fine acidity in 2006."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This is a strong, oaky Chardonnay. It's crisp in acidity and forward in pineapple jam, lemon custard and vanilla meringue flavors. If you like the ripe, California style, it's for you."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Crisp, coastal acidity dominates this wine, making it mouth-wateringly tart. May be too much for some folks, but it's quite elegant, with good cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors enriched with a touch of smoky oak."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Loaded with bold, ripe fruit, exotic spice and leather, this is a simple but genuine expression of Brunello di Montalcino. The wine tastes thick and a bit chunky in the mouth because of its chewy, succulent tannins."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "With attractive melon and other tropical aromas, this is a Torront√©s that rises above the masses. It smells great and tastes like a pure blend of lychee fruit, tangerine and honeydew melon. The palate feel is smooth and round, and the finish is dry, clean and healthy. It's everything that Torront√©s should be. Drink now."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This is a typical Sonoma Coast Chard in the bright acidity that firms up the ripe, long hangtime flavors. Pineapples, pears, peaches, nectarines and subtle papaya notes are joined with buttercream and cinnamon spices. Drink now."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Composed and structured, with its fair share of richness manifested as raisin and molasses. Interestingly, the palate rings with acidity, resulting in a feel that's borderline sharp. But there's enough fruit and heft to balance things out, and the flavors of cherry, blackberry and cola are nice. A good example of elevated Carmen√®re (with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon) that doesn't cost an arm and a leg."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This is a very rich Pinot whose primary virtue is fruit. It just explodes with delicious cherry jam, red currant, licorice and mocha flavors. Dry and crisply acidic, it's a beautiful wine for early drinking."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This is a luminous, mature red wine with thick concentration and huge‚Äîalmost too much‚Äîemphasis on toasted oak. Aromas recall vanilla, spice and coffee, although you will find blueberry and cherry on the finish: It is a blend of Nero d'Avola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Bisquertt usually does well with its value-priced Merlots, and seeing that 2007 was an excellent vintage in Chile, this wine excels in the value price range. The nose is dark and saturated, but pure and inviting. And the palate is ripe and smooth, with spice, plum, blackberry and herb notes, particularly anise. Finishes clean, smooth and peppery. Drink now."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Clean and honest up front, with moderate richness and modest telltale Casablanca pineapple aromas. The plate is creamier than many wines in this price range, with flavors of apple cider, citrus and some pith. Overall this is a good value wine with enough citrus and acidity to qualify it as fresh."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Chocolate, espresso, plum and black currant are backed by smoky nuances and natural rubber. This muscular wine offers polished tannins and firm structure to the end. A bit of wine from the 2005 and 2006 vintages is blended in."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "From the little-known region of Padthaway, this Cabernet starts off with some very promising, perfumed aromas of mint and cassis, but then shows touches of chocolate and raisined fruit on the palate. It's soft and mouthfilling‚Äîan easy-drinking Cab to consume on the young side."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Here's an interesting blend of Corvina, Cabernet Sauvignon and Rondinella that reflects the aromas and power of each grape variety. The wine offers mature notes of cherry, clove, blackberry and cola: It tastes slightly sweet and very succulent."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "A citrus-dominated wine, lime and lemon giving a crisp intensity. There is a somewhat bitter toast element, but the acidity, the fresh fruits and the soft structure act as a counter-balance. Give it six months to a year. Screwcap."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Here's a traditional Chianti Classico with pretty aromas of cherry cola, mesquite, almonds and violets. The wine is compact and elegant in the mouth and offers crisp berry flavors on the close."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This is a mature, jammy wine with thick layers of plum, prune and raisin. The wine's appearance is dark and concentrated and that same sensation of heaviness carries over the palate in the form of black currant and spice. The tannins are firm and tart."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Pancole is a pretty expression of Tuscany's popular Vernaccia di San Gimignano with a luminous, bright appearance and pristine aromas of stone and passion fruits. The wine is lean and tonic with spicy notes on the finish."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This is a concentrated, fairly full and lush Chenin, rich in toasty oak and vanilla cream as well as notes of baked apple pie and sweet orange. The medium-weight palate is mouthfilling and satisfying, with ample acidity to lift the decadent flavors. Notes of clove, anise and toasted nuts mingle on the lingering finish. Drink now‚Äì2019."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This is a soft, well-crafted wine from the eastern side of St. Helena that's both classic in its dried herb, tobacco and tea aromas and fruity with red currant and cranberry notes."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This is a beatifully balanced, not-too-full-bodied wine from vines grown at 2,400 feet in the Sierra range. It has classic black cherry, black olive and anise aromas, harmonious fruit flavors accented with light oak spiciness and a firm, fine-grained tannic structure."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Aromas of mature black-skinned berry, tobacco and dark spice lead the way. The rounded palate offers dried cherry, raspberry, coffee and a licorice note alongside velvety if not very persistent tannins. Showing the heat of the vintage, this is evolving quickly so enjoy over the next several years."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Made with 60% Pinot Bianco, 30% Chardonnay and 10% Sauvignon Blanc, this boasts appealing aromas of acacia flower, nectarine and Alpine herb. The elegant palate delivers juicy Gala apple, yellow peach and a touch of ginger alongside fresh acidity."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This wine features pleasing aromas of raspberry, jumper berry and black pepper. There is a nice m√©lange of fruit and spice flavors, notably black cherry, dark plums, anise, and cardamom. Smooth tannins ply the palate right into a bright finish that bears a touch of salinity."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "A year in wood and 30 months in bottle before release have allowed this attractive wine to fully develop its solid yet smooth texture. It has concentration, layers of bright black currant fruit and vibrant acidity. Ready to drink."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This bottling belongs to a series of wines from the legendary Jerry Lohr emphasizing Rh√¥ne varieties. It shows candied blackberry, violets and potpourri on the fruity, flowery and inviting nose. The palate leads with savory black pepper, which accents its core of black plum, blackberry and purple flower flavors."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Rich honeysuckle, marzipan and oak aromas meet bright lemongrass on the nose of this bottling, showing both the fresh and oxidative sides of the grape. Smoked chicken and brioche notes are prominent on the palate, leading to a tangy, botanical, juniper-laced finish."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This is an extraordiary deal for a solidly built, high-level wine. It offers succulent cherry, raspberry and vanilla flavors, wrapped in approachable, mellowed tannin and oak."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Juicy and austere in understated waves of cranberry and cherry fruit, this wine delivers subtle power and intensity in a leathery-textured package. True to its old vine heritage, it shows a dry dustiness of peppery spice."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "A stony, flinty character leads the nose of this blend of 54% Sauvignon Blanc and 46% S√©millon, followed by scents of ripe peach, nectarine, freshly dried grass and herbs. The medium-weight palate offers more clean fruit flavors that result in a smooth, slightly creamy mouthfeel. Ample acidity lends freshness to the finish, alongside a lingering yellow flower character. Drink now‚Äì2019."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Intriguing, thought provoking and complex, this wine starts off with perfumed aromas of thyme, bay leaf and lavender. It's supple in the mouth and silky in feel, imbued with black cherry and blueberry fruit, then shows a hint of adhesive bandage on the finish. Drink now."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This leads with clean yet soft scents of ripe apple, Anjoy pear and orange blossom. Those notes carry through to the medium-weight palate, well integrated with soft toasted-oak tones. It's harmonious and balanced, with ample acidity lending good lift through the close. Drink now."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This is taut and sinewy in profile, but shows off a fine range of aromas, from thyme and lavender to cocoa, red plum and ripe cherry. The raspberry and herb flavors finish in a storm of firm tannins. Drink 2020‚Äì2025."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Mellow white-fruit aromas are nonspecific and oaky, but not overly so. This barrel-fermented Verdejo feels plump and chunky, with balancing acidity. Salty melon, apricot and apple flavors end steady and long. For barrel-fermented Verdejo, this is at the top of the pile."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This blend of 60% Petite Sirah, 21% Syrah, 7% Grenache, 6% Petit Verdot, 5% Tannat and 1% Viognier is tightly wound but likely to improve with time. Opened now, it offers elderberry, black currant, pencil lead and loam on the nose, with lava rock, cr√®me de cassis and kirsch flavors slowing emerging on the palate."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This is a big, brawny expression of Grenache, Mourv√®dre, Syrah and Counoise, the Grenache playing the dominant role in the blend. It coats the palate in dense raspberry and blueberry fruit, seasoned with pepper and nutmeg. A leathery touch to the texture and lifted acidity keeps it from feeling heavy or overdone."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Aromas of blackberry, fennel bulb and smoke set the scene for flavors of cherry, raspberry, chocolate and tobacco leaf. Mellow but ever-apparent tannins ply the palate alongside a strong bolt of acidity that tapers off into a pomegranate-imbued finish."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Black-skinned berry, pipe tobacco and Mediterranean herb aromas waft out of the glass and carry over to the firm linear palate along with morello cherry, licorice and a hint of clove. Taut fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide the backbone while orange peel marks the finish. Drink 2019‚Äì2025."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Wood aging gives this ripe blend of Baga and Touriga Nacional its richness and density. It's full of black fruit, toast and a touch of pepper. With ripe tannins and crisp acidity, it can easily age another year. Drink from 2018."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Pithy, with grapefruit and lemon peel flavors, this wine is deceptively crisp and light on the nose, offering a wealth of body and lushness on the palate, accented with nutmeg and peach. It includes 4% S√©millon, partly from the winery's beloved To Kalon vineyard."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "From a vineyard in Northern Tokaj this dry Furmint has aromas of citrus pith and freshly cut pineapple. In the mouth, there are delightful flavors of grapefruit juice and white peach before the pleasantly acidic finish."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Briny green olive notes underlie a tropically ripe, full-bodied expression of the variety. The wine's apple, pineapple and mango fruit is wrapped in toasted oak and moderate acidity."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This opens with enticing aromas of chamomile flower, white peach and a whiff of Alpine herb. The elegant palate offers McIntosh apple, candied lemon and a vein of energizing mineral. Fresh acidity lends balance."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Chopped herb, forest floor, leather, espresso and a balsamic note are some of the aromas that waft out of the glass. The powerfully structured palate delivers prune, dried cherry, tobacco, and roasted coffee bean framed in firm fine-grained tannins. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink to capture the fruit richness. Drink 2018‚Äì2023."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Bright and creamy, this savory white offers aromas and flavors of ripe apple, Bartlett pear, Alpine herb and a citrus note. Fresh acidity and a mineral vein energize the finish."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Blackberry and road-tar aromas are dark and stout. This is moderately tannic and a bit rough and jagged on the palate. Flavors of stewed black plum and prune are ripe almost to an extreme, and that's how it finishes as well."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "There's a pleasant, toasty seam throughout the nose and mouth of this well-balanced wine, expressed in notes of sweet spice and honeycomb that frame the yellow melon and apple fruit core. It's plush and mouthfilling, but not flabby or overdone, thanks to balancing acidity and an assertive spicy tone that dominates the finish. Drink now."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This is a round and rich wine, with notes of wood-grilled apple, guava and toasted challah. Smooth and lush in feel, ripe peach and tropical tones drive the palate, while hints of honeysuckle and baking spice unfold on the finish. Ample acidity keeps the wine's weight in check. Drink now."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "The deep ruby color belies this wines cool-climate origins. The nose shows more black fruit aromas than is typical for Pinot Noir. The palate is all Pinot, though, with cherry pie filling flavors made more complex by vanilla from toasty new oak. It finishes with some nice mineral and earth notes. Silky tannins allow for immediate consumption but the wine will gain in complexity after a year or two in the cellar."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "A thoroughly honest effort, opening with lovely quince, apple and lemon fruit. The palate has a crisp lime edge and finishes with a kick of refreshing acidity. Drink now."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Not clear what the varietal blend is, but it's like a nice, easy southern Rh√¥ne wine. Soft and fruity, it's rich in jammy blackberry, cherry, Mandarin orange, chocolate and anise spice flavors."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Orange blossom and flowers lead on this Gew√ºrtz, and on the palate, a citric, lemon edge outweighs the sweet and floral components that would give this wine a prettier edge. Nonetheless, the wine has an attractive, crisp and clean character and will pair well with grilled seafood and poultry."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Meaty and rubbery, but that's young Bonarda. This is a sound wine with dark berry flavors, raisin and pulsing acidity. Still, there's modest roundness to the palate and length to the finish. Overall, it's tasty, full and borderline raisiny. Drink now."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Lifted cedar and pine notes interspersed with appealing woodsy scents give way to a surprisingly intense palate that shows some nice peppery notes but ultimately falls short on the finish. Nearly imperceptible tannins suggest early consumption."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "There is an odd, piercing edge to the aromas, a mix of acetic acid and pungent herb, with a hint of diesel. Somehow it's not off-putting, just atypical. The light, tart fruit is a mix of rhubarb and cranberry, very earthy and tasting of dirt and bark in the finish. This could be quite pleasant with a hearty, rustic dish such as beef Bourgogne."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Neutral and unassuming on first impact, this luminous ros√© eventually delivers notes of mineral, ash, stone fruit and small berry. The wine offers more in the mouth, however, where it exhibits fresh flavors of raspberry and blueberry."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Overly sweet and simple, and something of a disappointment given the winery's past performance, this Syrah tastes like melted cherry jam, stirred with chocolate pie filling and sprinkled with fennel and pepper."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Shows rich, firm mountain tannins and well-ripened, concentrated flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and cocoa, and is thoroughly dry. But the wine loses a few points for hot caramelization, which may be partly over-charred oak and partly shriveled, overripe berries, if not both."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "The wine boasts a beautiful appearance thanks to its saturated golden color and faint amber highlights. It has a very fragrant nose and offers honey, peach and soapy floral notes. In the mouth, the wine delivers sweet fruit and a soft, silky texture."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "The sort of wine one imagines early Australian settlers gulped down‚Äîbig and burly in the mouth and a bit warm, rough and dusty on the finish. Hints of mint-accented cherry fruit and earthy notes."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "A little rough and rugged, with jangly tannins and blackberry fruit so ripe it veers into raisins. Very dry, it's probably at its best now."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Dominated by Ugni Blanc, the grape also used in the local Armagnac brandy, this is a tight, crisp wine, green but not unpleasantly so. Its acidity comes from fresh apple flavors, touched with some good juiciness and a fine refreshing finish. Screwcap."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Sweetly rich in cherry, red currant and chocolate flavors, with a peppery edge, this Sangiovese is soft in structure. The bright acidity can cut through tomato sauce with cheese."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Made in the modern California style, with very ripe, rather sweet pineapple jam, green apple butter and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This sparkling wine starts with a toasty but soft nose, leading into clean but fruity flavors and a refreshing finish. Though an earlier release might have allowed more primary fruit to show through, the wine offers easygoing but elegant enjoyment."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Simple but well-maded wine with aromas of chewing gum, cherry and blackberry. It's a plump, sort of grabby red with sweet raspberry and chocolate flavors followed by a creamy, soft finish. Not much complexity but good fruit and depth. Not the least bit hard to drink. Good mass wine."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Not exactly a world-class white wine but at least it smells and tastes like Chardonnay. The nose offers some butter and lemon curd, while the palate is jumpy and tastes like a mix of pear, apple and spice. A fresh, young wine that should be drunk soon."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Juicy and well balanced, this is an admirable effort at the price. Boxwood, grapefruit, lemon and quince notes make for a sophisticated first impression. The palate is straightforward citrus while gooseberry notes pop up on the dry finish. Drink now."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "Tasty, with pie-filling cherries, blackberries and currants accented with smoky oak, but a little on the soft side. Fully developed, so drink now."}}
{"text_snippet": {"content": "This seems as if it was assembled from lesser barrels. It's pleasant, very light, simple and tart; the dominant flavor is cranberry juice."}}
